Video to Text Conversion
This project aims to convert a video file into text format using speech recognition. The script utilizes the Python programming language and the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for the conversion process.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

Python 3.x installed on your system
Google Cloud account with Speech-to-Text API enabled
Google Cloud project credentials (JSON key file) for authentication
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

shell
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-to-text-conversion.git
Navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy
cd video-to-text-conversion
Install the required Python packages using pip:

shell
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Rename the config.example.py file to config.py.

Open config.py and update the following variables with your Google Cloud project credentials:

python
Copy
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID = 'your-project-id'
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = '/path/to/your/credentials.json'
Usage
Place the video file you want to convert into the project directory.

Run the script using the following command:

shell
Copy
python convert_video_to_text.py --video video_file.mp4
Replace video_file.mp4 with the actual name of your video file.

The script will process the video file, extract the audio, and send it to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for transcription.

Once the transcription is complete, the script will save the text output to a file named output.txt.
